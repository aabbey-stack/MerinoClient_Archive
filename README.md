# MerinoClient_Archive
A public archive of my IL2CPP [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader) based VRChat all in one mod. As of 27/07/2022 CEST VRChat has added a kernel anti-cheat [Easy Anti-Cheat](https://www.easy.ac/en-us), due to this change MelonLoader becomes pretty much obsolete, due to it being open source mod loader which doesn't try to hide any dll injection at all (It's a mod loader after all). Because of these events I've decided to release my personal projects for **educational purposes**. All of the code I've used or referenced can be found in the code comments of the particular .cs file, but if you feel like I've missed you feel free to contact me and correct me. The repository will be archived and this project is discontinued.
