# MerinoClient_Archive
A public archive of my IL2CPP [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader) based VRChat all in one mod. As of [27/07/2022](https://hello.vrchat.com/blog/vrchat-security-update) CEST VRChat has added a kernel anti-cheat [Easy Anti-Cheat](https://www.easy.ac/en-us), due to this change MelonLoader becomes pretty much obsolete, due to it being open source mod loader which doesn't try to hide any dll injection at all (It's a mod loader after all). Because of these events I've decided to release my personal projects for **educational purposes**. All of the code I've used or referenced can be found in the code comments of the particular .cs file, but if you feel like I've missed you feel free to contact me and correct me. The repository will be archived and this project is discontinued.  
## Sister Repositories
My client uses the same system that [@RequiDev](https://github.com/RequiDev)! has adapted in his projects as well, that is a separate open-source dll library that would work by putting the dll into "UserLibs" folder.

It is fully open source and can be checked out here: [MerinoClient.Core](https://github.com/abbeybabbey/MerinoClient.Core).

I have loaded my client from a remote server using a simple MelonLoader based mod, which can be found here: [MerinoLoader](https://github.com/abbeybabbey/MerinoLoader_Archive)
## Final Notes
As you've noticed some weird parts of the code are missing. It is mostly a code that would handle authentication of my users. It wasn't made by me and wasn't open-source, so I've decided to strip it out.
